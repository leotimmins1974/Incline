//! The viewport bar: the row under the menu bar that carries everything about
//! the open workspace.
//!
//! Three clusters across one strip, the way Blender heads an editor:
//!
//! - **Left** - the project actions that are true in every workspace (save,
//!   import, export, undo, redo), followed by the menus belonging to the
//!   workspace itself.
//! - **Centre** - the working elevation shared by every workspace, plus what
//!   the workspace's tools will act on next: in Production the active layer,
//!   line colour and fill; in Drill & Blast the drill hole dataset being
//!   worked on.
//! - **Right** - the view controls, which used to float on a tile hung off the
//!   viewport's right edge.
//!
//! The centre is centred on the *window*, not on the space the other two
//! clusters leave, so it stays put as they change width - but it is clamped to
//! that space, so a narrow window slides it across rather than letting the
//! three overlap. Narrower still and the bar stops narrowing altogether and
//! scrolls under the wheel, the way a Blender header does - see
//! [`crate::ui::elements::bar_strip`].
